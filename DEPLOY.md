## Quick Deploy Test

To test if deployment is working:

1. Visit `/test.html` first
2. If that works, visit `/` or `/index.html`
3. If main app doesn't work, there might be an issue with the main HTML file

## Files in this deployment:
- index.html (main app)
- styles.css (all styles)
- script.js (all functionality)
- firebase-config.js (Firebase setup)
- test.html (deployment test)
- vercel.json (Vercel configuration)

## Troubleshooting:
If you get 404 errors:
1. Check if test.html loads
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify all files are in the repository root
4. Check Vercel build logs
